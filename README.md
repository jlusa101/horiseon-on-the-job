# Horiseon


## Description
---
Source code of a website Horiseon was provided by an imaginary client. My task was to refactor the existing code and make it accessible and to improve search engine optimization.

I ensured that all links in the source code were functioning as intended and I cleaned up the CSS file to make it more efficient. This includes and not limited to consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow a semantic structure of HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Requirements
---
No special requirements to run the website.
